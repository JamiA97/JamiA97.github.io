      <p>The job of serving text over the internet, with complete control over structure and representation, has yet to be accomplished as well as it theoretically could be.</p>
<p>It should be fast, cheap, and easily accessible to non-technical users. Block editors are okay, but pure text is faster and more portable. It&rsquo;s also free to host static files on most platforms, and databases are slow anyway.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;want a document store that&rsquo;s just a git repo of markdown but that also has a collaborative google docs style editor (synced by plain old commits) so that non devs will write their spec documents in it&rdquo;</em> - <a href="https://twitter.com/asingleoat/status/1686838180887265280">@asingleoat</a></p>

<p>I think the best way to get close to what I want is to build a platform on top of Hugo. It has the fastest build process, and templates are written in HTML and it&rsquo;s templating language that has a ton of useful functions built in.</p>
<p>IDK though, maybe I should let people bring in React and stuff too.</p>
