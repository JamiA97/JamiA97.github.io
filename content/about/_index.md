## Who I am

I’m an R&D engineer with deep experience in aerodynamics, performance definition, and advanced simulation for heavy-duty engine systems.  
Across more than a decades in industry, I’ve led development at the interface of fluid mechanics, data, and modelling—building practical, physics-grounded tools that improve real engineering decisions.

A recurring theme in my work is the belief that **small, well-designed tools can unlock disproportionate value**. Most engineering workflows don’t need monolithic systems; they need lightweight, precise utilities that fit naturally into how engineers think and build.  
**EDNA** was born directly from that philosophy.

## What this site is

This site collects experiments and ideas:

- **EDNA** – a lightweight CLI for engineering lineage.
