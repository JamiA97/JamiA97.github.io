## Who I am

Placeholder bio about the human behind EDNA and these notes. <!-- TODO: Replace with a short personal bio -->

## What this site is

This site collects experiments and ideas:

- **EDNA** – a lightweight CLI for engineering lineage.  
- **Notebook** – quick notes across philosophy, mathematics, computing, and general thoughts.  
- **Blog** – longer-form writing once drafts graduate from the notebook.
