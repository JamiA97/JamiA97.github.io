## EDNA – Engineering Design Lineage CLI

EDNA (`eng-dna`) tags engineering artefacts with stable DNA tokens and keeps their lineage in a local SQLite store—no server or heavyweight PLM required. It gives engineers a portable, file-system-native memory of how designs, scripts, simulations, and reports evolve.  

- Local-first CLI: tag, link, trace, and graph lineage straight from the shell.  
- Lightweight: JSON sidecars protect source files while SQLite holds the graph.  
- Portable: export/import lineage bundles to move projects between machines.
