| Type of Truth       | Definition                                                                 | Example                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Analytic**         | True by virtue of meanings; the predicate is contained in the subject      | "All bachelors are unmarried"    |
| **Synthetic**        | True or false depending on how the world is; not just by meaning           | "The cat is on the mat"          |
| **A priori**         | Knowable independently of experience                                       | "All triangles have three sides" |
| **A posteriori**     | Knowable only through experience                                           | "Water boils at 100Â°C at sea level" |
| **Necessary**        | True in all possible worlds                                                | "2 + 2 = 4"                       |
| **Contingent**       | True in this world, but could have been otherwise                         | "The Eiffel Tower is in Paris"   |
